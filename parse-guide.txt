#### Migrating from Parse to Rackspace

1) Log into Parse.com and migrate your database to ObjectRocket.
You can find instructions on how to do this here: https://objectrocket.com/parse

2) Log into MyCloud.Rackspace.com, and go to Orchestration -> Stack Templates
Select 'Parse' from the list, then select 'Create Stack'
Alternately, you can click here to create the stack.
//INSERT DIRECT LINK TO STACK PARAMS PAGE

3) Fill out the form with the URL and e-mail address to use with Parse.  You can
also add information regarding a Git repository to pull custom code from.  The
Git information is optional.

4) Once the stack has been successfully created, log into the
server via SSH, as either 'root', using the SSH key provided, or as 'parse',
using the password provided.
The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
as well as [Windows using
PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
If you are still having issues logging in, you can reach out to Rackspace Support
and we can assist you.

5) Once logged into the primary server, modify
'/home/parse/ecosystem.json'.  You must configure the following
information in 'ecosystem.json':
MongoDB Connection String
Application ID
Master Key

These values can be found at Parse.com, under "App Settings" > "Security and Keys"
Any other application-specific keys are optional, and should be left blank if
not used.

The configuration file should look like the following:
{
  "apps" : [{
    "name"        : "parse-wrapper",
    "script"      : "/usr/local/bin/parse-server",
    "watch"       : true,
    "merge_logs"  : true,
    "cwd"         : "/home/parse",
    "env": {
      "PARSE_SERVER_CLOUD_CODE_MAIN": "/home/parse/cloud/main.js",
      "PARSE_SERVER_DATABASE_URI": "mongodb://user:password@ip:27017/db",
      "PARSE_SERVER_APPLICATION_ID": "your_application_id",
      "PARSE_SERVER_MASTER_KEY": "your_master_key",
      "PARSE_SERVER_COLLECTION_PREFIX": "collection_prefix",
      "PARSE_SERVER_CLIENT_KEY": "your_client_key",
      "PARSE_SERVER_REST_API_KEY": "your_rest_key",
      "PARSE_SERVER_DOTNET_KEY": "your_dotnet_key",
      "PARSE_SERVER_JAVASCRIPT_KEY": "your_javascript_key",
      "PARSE_SERVER_FILE_KEY": "your_file_key",
      "PARSE_SERVER_FACEBOOK_APP_IDS": "app1, app2, app3",
      "PARSE_MOUNT": "/1",
    }
  }]
}


6) After any changes have been made to 'ecosystem.json', Parse must be restarted.
Do so by running the following two commands (as the 'Parse' user)
> pm2 stop parse-wrapper
> pm2 start ecosystem.json
Repeat this step on all servers that were created by this stack.
The 'parse' password should be the same across all servers.  These servers will
be linked to via the Stack page, which should be displayed once you create your
stack.  You can also find it by going to MyCloud, then selecting Orchestration ->
Stacks, then clicking the name of your stack.

7) Custom code will likely need to be modified before it will run successfully.
You can find more information about this here.
https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server/wiki/Migrating-an-Existing-Parse-App#3-cloud-code
You can view the logs of Parse at '/home/parse/.pm2/logs/'

This stack already has all of the Cloud Code replacements installed.

8) Once Parse is running, configure a valid certificate within
Nginx.  This can be done by modifying '/etc/nginx/conf.d/<your url>.conf', where
<your url> is replaced with the URL you provided in step 3.  If you do not have
a valid certificate, you can purchase one through Rackspace if you are currently
hosting a physical server with us.  If you aren't sure, please contact your Account
Manager or Rackspace Support to determine if you are able.

9) This stack also comes with Parse Dashboard, which lets you visualize all the
Parse applications running on this server.  This is configured separately from
'parse-server'.  The configuration is located in
'/home/parse/parse-dashboard-config.json'.  You must configure your
Application ID and Master Key inside of this file if you would like to use
Parse Dashboard.

The configuration file should look like the following:
{
  "apps": [
    {
      "serverURL": "https://your_api_url/parse",
      "appId": "your_application_id",
      "masterKey": "your_master_key",
      "appName": "Your Application"
    }
  ]
}

After you modify this file, you need to restart the Parse Dashboard
service, by running the following command:
>service parse-dashboard restart


10) Now that you have your Parse server set up, you should be able to start
testing!
