  Parse Server is an open-source version of the Parse backend that can be
  deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js.

  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to Parse, you can find list of tutorials and examples at
  [Parse.com](https://parse.com/tutorials).

  After the stack has been created, you can find the admin username and
  password listed in the "Credentials" section of Stack Details.

  PLEASE NOTE: If you configure this stack with secondary servers, you will need
  to restart parse-server on the secondary nodes once the configuration has been
  synchronized via Lsyncd.  In order to restart parse-server, you will need to
  log into the server via SSH as 'parse', then run the following commands:
  > pm2 stop parse-wrapper
  >
  > pm2 start ecosystem.json

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This deployment was stood up using [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/).
  Once the stack has been deployed, Ansible will not run again unless you update the
  stack. **Any changes made to the configuration may be overwritten when the stack
  is updated.**

  [Parse-server](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server) was installed
  via NPM, and is configured to be run from '/home/parse', as the user 'parse'.
  NPM was also used to install the latest version of Node.js for use with
  Parse-server.  In order to restart parse-server, you will need to log into the
  server via SSH as 'parse', then run the following commands:
  > pm2 stop parse-wrapper
  >
  > pm2 start ecosystem.json

  [Parse Dashboard](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-dashboard) was also
  installed via NPM, and is configured to run using the configuration file
  '/home/parse/parse-dashboard-config.json'.  You can find more information
  about Parse Dashboard and the configuration
  [here](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-dashboard/blob/master/README.md).
  After any changes are made to the configuration, you will need to restart
  the dashboard by running the following command:
  > service parse-dashboard restart

  [Lsyncd](https://github.com/axkibe/lsyncd) has been installed in order to
  sync static content from the primary server to all secondary servers.  In
  order to update any custom code you might have, you only need to upload the
  code to the primary server, under '/home/parse', and it will be replicated to
  all other nodes in the stack.

  [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) was installed in order to serve the Parse API
  over HTTPS.  It is configured with a 301 redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, and to
  pass all requests from <URL>/parse/ to the parse-server.

  #### Configuring Parse-server
  Parse-server is configured using the environment variables in
  '/home/parse/ecosystem.json'.  This includes the connection string for
  MongoDB, the Application ID, the Master Key, as well as any additional
  platform-specific keys you would like to configure.  If you need to update any
  of this information, or would prefer not to provide the information to
  Rackspace directly, you can configure the 'ecosystem.json' file yourself.

  Backups are configured using Cloud Backups.  The primary server is configured
  to back up /home/parse once per week, and to retain these backups for 30 days.

  Monitoring is configured to verify that parse is running on both the primary
  and all secondary servers, as well as that the Cloud Load Balancer is
  functioning.  Additionally, the default CPU, RAM, and Filesystem checks
  are in place on all servers.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Additional Notes
  You can add additional servers to this deployment by updating the
  "server_count" parameter for this stack.

  This stack will not ensure that parse-server or the servers themselves are
  up-to-date.  You are responsible for ensuring that all software is
  updated.

  #### Production - RCv3

  Parse Server is an open-source version of the Parse backend that can be
  deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js.  This stack requires an
  existing MongoDB instance.
